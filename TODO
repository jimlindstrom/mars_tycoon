- When the economy is out of whack:
    - I should get some kind of alert
    - population growth should stop. (and eventually reverse?)
    - the rest of the economy should just randomly brown-out and continue partially function if possible (***)
- It would be nice for the economy screen to show resources that are possible but don't exist yet. like methane and ore, initially.
- It would be nice if the econ screen were merged into the main UI or the build UI as hints
- I should not be allowed to move rovers on top of assets
- I should not be allowed to build assets on top of other assets
- Dust storms should do something upon impact.
- We shouldn't be SO far into the future.
